- up to 1.6
- added -setup.patch: updated addresses, version
- added examples, created subpackage
- use setup.py (instead packaging it)
- rel. 0.1 - I have reservations how `lex.py' works (I've
  also tested older ver. - 1.5 - the same): I wrote similar
  programs for flex(1) and for ply lex.py and I've gotten
  expected results from flex(1) whereas from lex.py not.
